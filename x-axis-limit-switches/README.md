# SainSmart Genmitsu 3018-PRO x-axis limit switch

The x-axis limiter is based on two sub miniature leaf spring switches to sense when the spindle has reached the edge of the x-axis.
This leaves only a couple of millimeters to the edge of the x-axis on either side.

## Files

This design consists of two files; x-axis-limit-switch-left and x-axis-limit-switch-right. These pieces are near identical but the right switch has a 2mm longer extrusion to accompany for the stepper motor screws.

## Parts

### Switch

The limit switch holder is designed around a sub miniature leaf spring switch with dimensions of approx. 6.5 x 12.8 x 5.8mm.
Example model that should fit this design: [CYT1073](https://www.amazon.com/Cylewet-25Pcs-Switch-Arduino-CYT1073/dp/B073TYWX86).

### Cables

Any pair of low power cables should suffice for this application. However it is recommended to use a maximum cable dimension of 1.5mm2 to make it easier to solder them onto the tiny switch contacts.

### Contacts

The original Genmitsu 3018-PRO control board has a standard dupont pinout for the limit switch connectors and it is therefore recommended to use a dupont crimping tool and connectors to connect the switches to the control board.
